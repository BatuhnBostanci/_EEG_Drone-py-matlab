# EEG_Drone
"In this project, the goal is to read spectrogram waves generated by brain power using image processing. Then, process the images using MATLAB technology. Communicate with the drone coded in Python using the processed image in MATLAB. Ultimately, enable the drone to fly autonomously by solely thinking."
